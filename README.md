My name is Isis Duarte and I'm a systems analysis and development student. 
I also have a degree in nursing and a technical course in environmental control, but at the moment I seek to explore new technologies and all the magic that compose them. Besides coding, I also enjoy playing video games, watching Korean dramas and playing with my cats.
